The Synchronized Time-Base Manager (StbM) is a Basic Software Module of the System Services.

1. Synchronized Time-Base Manager is to provide a “global
time” to other BSW modules or to the application. 

2.Global time means, that different entities within the system 
have the same definition of time and passage of time

3.In the system, multiple “global times” can exist simultaneously 

4. Synchronized Time-Base Manager shall provide means for state/error notification 

Main use cases for the application of the Synchronized Time-Base Manager are the
following:
 Synchronized execution of several RunnableEntities within one system cluster
 Provision of an accurate definition of the absolute value of time
 Provision of an accurate definition of the passage of time

Time provision -
Guaranteeing the accurate triggering of OS alarms every (well-defined)interval.

The application (and other BSW modules) shall have a central module that is
responsible for the provision of information about the absolute time and passage of
time.

Absolute time provision -
In some cases an absolute time value (relative to the start of the ECU) is needed.
E.g. in safety related systems it might be necessary to test the system every 48
hours.



. If AUTOSAR compliant application software  must execute with a predictable timing 
 a suitable common time definition must be used. 
 The STBM is responsible for the propagation of such a time definition.
